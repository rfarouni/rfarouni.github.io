Favorite Quotes 
=======================

>“No one should approach the temple of science with the soul of a money changer" -*Sir Thomas Browne (1605-1682), English physician and writer*{: style="color: #7BD2FF"}

>"Turing’s legacy for the cognitive and brain sciences can thus be summarized by observing that, just as nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . .., nothing about the mind/brain makes sense except in the light of computation." -*Shimon Edelman*{: style="color: #7BD2FF"}

>"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise." -*John Tukey*{: style="color: #7BD2FF"}

> "There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened." -*Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*{: style="color: #7BD2FF"}  

> " The brain is a machine assembled not to understand itself, but to survive. Because these two ends are basically different, the mind unaided by factual knowledge from science sees the world only in little pieces. It throws a spotlight on those portions of the world it must know in order to live the next day." -*E.O. Wilson*{: style="color: #7BD2FF"}

> " Information has its own architecture. Each data source, whether imagery, sound, text, has an inner architecture which we should attempt to discover." -*David Donoho, Plenary Address at ICM 2012*{: style="color: #7BD2FF"}  


> " The P vs. NP problem has been called "one of the most important problems in contemporary mathematics and theoretical computer science" .... That is an understatement. Not only is P vs. NP the defining question of our field; it's one of the deepest questions ever asked for which we'd know how to recognize an answer...If P=NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in "creative leaps," no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it's found. Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss." -*Scott Aaronson*{: style="color: #7BD2FF"}
