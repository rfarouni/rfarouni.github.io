# How to Install MACS2 on the Ohio Supercomputer Center's Oakley Cluster


MACS2 requires Python 2.7 and a GCC complier for installation. You can read more about the installation 
requirements [here](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/wiki/Install-MACS2)

In bash, run

~~~~~~~~
module list
~~~~~~~~

This gives

```
Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) torque/5.1.3-1462984387_205d70d       3) intel/15.0.3   5) modules/au2015
  2) moab/8.1.1.2-2015080516-eb28ad0-el6   4) mvapich2/2.1
```  

We now load the Anaconda module to install the dependencies. Now since Oakley loads the Anaconda3 distribution by default, we create a self-contained Conda Python 2 enviornment. Let's call the enviroment *py2k*

~~~~~~~~
module load anaconda
conda create -n py2k python=2 anaconda
~~~~~~~~

Next we activate the enviroment 

~~~~~~~~
source activate py2k
~~~~~~~~

Note that the path to Python 2 gets prepended

```
discarding /usr/local/anaconda/anaconda3/bin from PATH
```

```
prepending /users/PAS1129/osu9535/envs/py2k/bin to PATH
```


A great way to install bioinformatics package dependencies effortlessly is to use [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/), a distribution of bioinformatics software which can be accessed through the Conda package manager. To add the Bioconda and R channels, which several packages depend on, run 

~~~~~~~~
conda config --add channels r
conda config --add channels bioconda
~~~~~~~~

Next we swap the intel compilers with the GNU GCC compiler

~~~~~~~~
module load gnu/5.2.0
~~~~~~~~

You should get this message

```
Lmod is automatically replacing "intel/15.0.3" with "gnu/5.2.0"
```

We are almost ready to install MACS2, but first we need to install pip and setuptools so MACS2 is able to install Python packages from PyPI.


~~~~~~~~
conda install pip
conda install setuptools
~~~~~~~~

Next we install MACS2

~~~~~~~~
conda install MACS2
~~~~~~~~

Next time you log in or when submitting a batch job, just load the anaconda distribution and activate the Python 2 Conda enviornment 

~~~~~~~~
module load anaconda
source activate py2k
~~~~~~~~

You should be able to use MACS2 now.
